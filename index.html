<h1>Anxiety</h1>

<p>I don’t know when it started. Mom told me about the meltdowns when I was little. She told me that it was like the world became too intense and I was becoming a puddle in my stroller. </p>

<p>The next time I remember was when it manifested as massive stomach ache on the first day of primary school. Or the first time I walked on campus every time school started up again. Meltdown&#39;s happened in between but never ever in front of people I didn’t trust implicitly like my parents. I don’t particularly like people seeing me at my most vulnerable. Back then I could manage my anxiety; it was always a low dull in the back of my mind. </p>

<p>But now it’s crippling, now I have a hard time sometimes walking out of my door. Sometimes my room. Sometimes I go without eating because just the taught of leaving, left me panic and laced with anxiety. The dull hum and become a loud buzzing that I can&#39;t ignore anymore. My bad days are now filled with. Was it <strong><em>HIM</em> </strong>that destroyed me? Was it <em>HIM </em>that made me<strong> hate myself</strong> and became the meek person that I am? Was it my fault because I thought that <em>HE </em>loved me? Was it my fault that I opened to myself to <em>HIM</em> and <em>HE</em> hated me for it? It is the was the questions that run through my head like<em> if only</em> I listen or <em>what if</em> I <strong>did/said</strong> this. Like that will make you are the reason for the unfortunate things that happened to you that made you feel this way. </p>

<p>So what was the solution? Talking to people about it helped when I was ready, to people like my parents, therapist and career counsellor. But I quickly discover that talking and stopping because I feel fine won’t solve anything. I learned a healthy diet, exercise (when I feel like it) and a good night sleep is essential. Writing me severe panic attack thoughts down has helped. Going back to the place that it happened, hearing his name and memories. Made me realize that there’s a lot more <em>healing</em> my future. </p>

<p>But I’ve come to terms with my anxiety and that it will forever be a part of me.</p>
